# edU_ed_with_multiple_Undo
Algorithms and Data Structures course project

The project implements a simple text editor inspired from the traditional editor ed (Unix). The editor considers a document as a sequence of lines (with arbitrary length).
The editor interface is composed by textual commands ended by the Enter command. The commands are constituted by one letter optionally preceded by one or two integer numbers. These numbers represent the lines and the first line of text has address 1.
The commands are described in the PDF file with an example of input and output texts.
